\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f0\fs22\lang9 Rosa Shopping Bot - P0\par
Project Details:\par
\par
Client shopping is requested through a prompt of client choices ( Samuel, Tina, Frank)\par
Pick Samuel for client\par
Pick Grocery for Vendor\par
Samuel is a fully functioning automated bot that takes in a bulk shopping subscription order.\par
He retrieves his bulk order from file ( Shopping List Grocery.xlsx) and then sends it to Vendor ( Grocery) Order.xlsx which then updates his order as well as calulates his Inventory values and also updates his subtotal.\par
When the bulk order is complete samuel receives a receipt at file Receipt-Samuel.xlsx\par
The other clients are still in progress but will receive the same level of automation on further development.\par
