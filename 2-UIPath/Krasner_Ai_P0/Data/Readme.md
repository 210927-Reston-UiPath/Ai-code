Rosa Shopping Bot - P0
Project Details:

Client shopping is requested through a prompt of client choices ( Samuel, Tina, Frank)
Pick Samuel for client
Pick Grocery for Vendor
Samuel is a fully functioning automated bot that takes in a bulk shopping subscription order.
He retrieves his bulk order from file ( Shopping List Grocery.xlsx) and then sends it to Vendor ( Grocery) Order.xlsx which then updates his order as well as calulates his Inventory values and also updates his subtotal.
When the bulk order is complete samuel receives a receipt at file Receipt-Samuel.xlsx
The other clients are still in progress but will receive the same level of automation on further development.
